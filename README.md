# sweet-potato üç†

An opinionated and minimal static website generator.  
The goal is to be simple and allow the composing and styling of pages without getting in the way and with minimal footprint.

Please see the [Documentation](https://wethegit.github.io/sweet-potato/) for more details.

## Development

When developing, please make your pull requests against dev instead of main. This allows us to roll features into releases more easily. Versions should only be modified on dev branch before pull into main.
