## Pages

Adding pages to your site is as easy as creating folders for each of them within the pages/ directory, and placing an index.pug file in each.

The "root" or "home" page of your site does not need to live in its own folderâ€”it will just need an index.pug file at the root of pages/.

A site with a homepage, about page, and contact page might have a pages/ structure like this:

```
pages/
  |-- index.pug
  |-- about/
      |-- index.pug
  |-- contact/
      |-- index.pug
```

For detail on how pug works, check out the [pug website](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)

### TODO: Markdown explanation

### Language and the page object

Language information is included in the `page` object and reflects the structure included in your localisation yaml files.

If you have the following yaml file:

```yaml
header:
  h1: Lorem ipsum
  h3: Exercitation aliquip ipsum commodo pariatur sint ea nulla tempor.
```

You can address the h1 as:

```pug
h1!= page.header.h1
```

For more information on language files and localization, please see [3. Language and Localisation](https://github.com/wethegit/sweet-potato/wiki/3.-Language-and-Localisation).

### Globals

During development you will sometimes want to use global and environment variable supplied at compile time. For example, you might want to refer to the root of the website without making assumptions as to where the current document exists in the tree, like so:

```pug
+script({ src: `${globals.RELATIVE_ROOT}/home.js` })
```

All compile-time variables live in the `globals` object and include true globals, relative (to document) variables, environment variables, the contents of `/locales/default.yml`, and runtime globals.

#### True globals

**BREAKPOINTS**  
_globals.BREAKPOINTS_

An object containing all of the breakpoints provided by the configuration. To output what these values are for review and debugging, add the following to your pug template:

```pug
  dl
    each val, i in globals.BREAKPOINTS
      dt!= i
      dd!= val
```

#### Relative variables

Relative variables relate to the page or the locale being compiled.

**RELATIVE_ROOT**  
_globals.RELATIVE_ROOT_

The relative location of the website root. Most often this is used to refer to assets like images, CSS or JS file etc.

**PAGE_SLUG**  
_globals.PAGE_SLUG_

The slug of the page being compiled.

**RELATIVE_LOCALE_ROOT**  
_globals.RELATIVE_LOCALE_ROOT_

The relative location of the locale root.

**LOCALE_KEY**  
_globals.LOCALE_KEY_

The key for the locale the page belongs to. If the page exists on the root locale, this value will be `default`.

#### Environment variables

Any variables present in the project .env file being used will also be present on the global option. By default this includes `PUBLIC_URL`, however anything you want to change from environment to environment can be included here.

**PUBLIC_URL**  
_globals.PUBLIC_URL_

The full public URL of the website. this is useful when you want to include a fully canonical link to something on the website and its inclusion in the env files allows this to change from environment to environment. For more information on environments and environment variables, please see [Environment](https://github.com/wethegit/sweet-potato/wiki/Environments)

### Model

The model - or runtime globals - allow you to populate an object with variables statically, dynamically or drawn from an API at compile time. To compile data for this object you would create a data folder relative to the page you wanted to apply it to. For example if you wanted to compile some news data, your folder structure might look like this:

```
pages/
  |-- index.pug
  |-- about/
      |-- index.pug
  |-- news/
      |-- data/
          |-- index.js
      |-- index.pug
```

The compiler will then consume that index.js file and append the result of its promise to the `model` object.

#### Example

```
pages/
  |-- index.pug
  |-- data/
      |-- index.js
```

The contents of `data/index.js`:

```js
module.exports = async function () {
  const data = {
    testing: "Hello World",
  };
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve(data);
  });
};
```

In index.pug:

```pug
p!= model.testing
```

Will output "Hello World".
